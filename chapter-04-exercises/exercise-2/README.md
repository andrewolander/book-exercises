# Exercise 2
Using the text-edit of your choice (e.g., Atom), create a new file called `README.md`. Alternatively, you may clone this repository and edit this file.

In your `README.md` document, make a three column table of the current courses you are taking, with separate columns for course number (in **bold**), course title (in _italics_), and instructor name.

Note that you can preview this Markdown in Atom to make sure it works correctly.

|**Course Number**|_Course Title_|Instructor Name|
|---|:---:|---|
|**270**| _Art/Identity Politics: Issues Of Representations In Contemporary Art_| Kolya Rice|
|**115**| _General Physics_|Usama A Al-Binni|
|**201**|_Technical Foundations_|Kyle Thayer|
|**405**|_Introduction to Biochemistry_| Frank Dimaio|
